I recieved a scam Mail. I wrote this script to fill out the form. The webiste went offline pretty quick. I only filled out the form for the banking details.

Got the same eMail with diffrent URLs. I modified the script to the current URL.

the scammers realized that they are getting trolled. They modifie the URL everytime I fix my script
https://ucim.eu/raiffeisenbank/lograiffeisenFull/
https://ucim.eu/mein-elba/lograiffeisenFull/
https://ucim.eu/raiffeisenbank/lograiffeisenFull/

So I added aditional code to overcome the issue, by reading the URL from the eMAIL link and folowing the JavaScript redirection
